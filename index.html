      <h4>Tim Burners-Lee History</h4>
        Tim-Burners Lee was born on June 8, 1955 in London, United Kingdom (66 years old). <br> He was involved in many different profsseions such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Computer Scientist</li>
        <li>Software Developper</li>
        <li>Inventor</li>
        <li>Researcher</li>
        <li>Web Developper</li>
        <li>Orator</li>
        <li>Physicist</li>
        <li>University Teacher</li>
      </ul>
      Tim Berners-Lee was born into an intelligent family of computer scientists, as both of his parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer. Growing up, Tim was fascinated with railways as he had a model railway in his room. This hobby of his eventually made him more fascinated in electronics than trains. One of his earliest memories is a conservation with his father about how computers would one day behave like the humain brain. As he grew up, he attended and later graduated from the pretigious Univeristy of Oxoford in 1976 and from here, he went on to design computer softwares for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd. Following this, he recevied and worked in the computer industry for several years as a programmer however, none of them lasted long. It wasn't until the early 1980's, where his life began to change after he accepted a sonculting position at CERN, near Geneva. 
      <h4>Contributions</h4>
      At CERN (a large particle physics laboratory) Tim worked as a software engineer. Here, scientists come from all over the world to use its accelerators, but Tim noticed   that they were having difficulty sharing information. He realized how millions of computers were being connected together through the fast-developing internet and how they could share information by exploiting an emerging technology called hypertext. In 1989, history was made and Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. <br> By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):
      <ul>
        <li>HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.</li>
        <li>URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.</li>
        <li>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.</li>
      </ul>
